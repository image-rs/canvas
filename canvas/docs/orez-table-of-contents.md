According to Daniele Procida we should look at four kinds of documentation
types. This seems useful to distinguish target audiences (and indeed, point out
at uses of a documentation that may be ignored from the state of mind of the
experienced developer writing it) so we adopt it here. This contains the parts
(underlying files are associated by use reverse spelled numberings to avoid
confusion of implied order). Use the chapter that best fits your current need.

You're also invited to bring PRs that improve the documentation. That
especially extends to beginners for the tutorial sections who can identify
gaps. Don't be afraid of a PR sketch being rough or incomplete.
